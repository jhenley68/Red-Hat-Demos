  The Ansible Automation Platform provides a intuitive web user-interface.  This can be locked down so that only certain indidivuals or groups can launch Jobs on specific inventory.  This allows automation to have guard rails on who can automate what.  Users don't have to be an Ansible Playbook writers to launch and use automation.
